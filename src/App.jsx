                    The elements of this language are entities called patterns.
                    Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over
                    again in our environment, and then describes the core of 
                    the solution to that problem, in such a way that you 
                    can use this solution a million times over,
                    without ever doing it the same way twice.

      <h3>
              each pattern has an introductory paragraph,
              which sets the context for the pattern,
              by explaining how it helps to complete certain larger patterns

              within the general ideas of location which
              <a href=''> 104 Site Repair</a> creates,
              this pattern governs the fundamental placing of the building
              and the open space around it with respect to sun.

                      <b>People use open space if it is sunny, and do not use it if it isn’t, in all but desert climates.</b>

      <h3>
              After the headline comes the body of the problem.
              This is the longest section. It describes the empirical background of the pattern,
              the evidence for its validity, the range of different ways 
              the pattern can be manifested in a building, and so on.
      </h3>
      <div>
              This is perhaps the most important single fact about a building.
              If the building is placed right, the building and its gardens
              will be happy places full of activity and laughter.
              If it is done wrong, then all the attention in the world,
              and the most beautiful details, will not prevent it from 
              being a silent gloomy place.
              Thousands of acres of open space in every city are wasted 
              because they are north of buildings and never get the sun.

              Then is the solution—the heart of the pattern—which describes 
              the field of physical and social relationships which are required 
              to solve the stated problem, in the stated context. 
              This solution is always stated in the form of an instruction
              —so that you know exactly what you need to do, to build the pattern.

              Always place buildings to the north of the outdoor spaces 
              that go with them, and keep the outdoor spaces to the south.
              Never leave a deep band of shade between the building 
              and the sunny part of the outdoors.</b>

                      which ties the pattern to all those smaller patterns
                      in the language, which are needed to complete this pattern,
                      to embellish it, to fill it out.
